TYPO3 performance analysis
**************************

``nr_perfanalysis`` is a TYPO3 extension that collects and displays
frontend rendering timing and quantity information.

It displays the summary at the bottom right of the frontend pages:

   TYPO3 introduction package rendering with nr_perfanalysis output

=====
Usage
=====
By enabling the extension, the frontend performance bar is automatically
shown whenever a TYPO3 page is generated.

Clicking on the bar hides it.

The reload button will do a "document.location.reload(true)" which will 
override the browser cache.

Hovering over the button shows the current document.location (helpful on 
devices that don't display a URL bar).

The start profiling button will reload the page and start a xhprof profiling. After
the reload you will get a link to see the results.

=================
Cookie Protection
=================
it is possible to enable the analysis but displaying the result in the frontend
only if you have a specific cookie set.

In the extenion manager you can enable the option ``Require cookie for displaying result in frontend (Cookie nr_perfanalysis=1 needs to be set)``
If this option is active the result will only be displayed if the current request
has the cookie ``nr_perfanalysis=1`` set.


Default performance indicators
==============================
``Browser``
  Browser `rendering time`__
``Page``
  Server-side page rendering time
``sql``
  SQL query count and time

=================
Custom indicators
=================
Your own extensions can collect statistical data, too.

Start an event::

    $statCounter = Netresearch\NrPerfanalysis\Counter::get();
    $statCounter->start('REST', 'PUT');

Finish it off::

    $statCounter = Netresearch\NrPerfanalysis\Counter::get();
    $statCounter->finish('REST', 'PUT');

Now you logged a "PUT" event in the "REST" group, and the REST group
will show up in the statistics on the bottom right.

======
Xhprof
======
To be able to use Xhprof it is necessary to have Xhprof installed.
In the extension manager you have to set the path to your Xhprof installation,
e.g. /srv/www/xhprof/ and the base-url under which you can see the profiler output,
e.g. www.yourserver.de/xhprof/.

============
Dependencies
============
- TYPO3 6.2+
- PHP 5.4+ for page generation statistics
